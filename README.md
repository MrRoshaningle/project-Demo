## 🔭 About Me
I'm an **AI/ML Engineer** who builds data-driven models and production-ready systems. I love going from research + model prototyping to deploying scalable solutions on the cloud. I also enjoy low-level programming (x86-64) and algorithm design.

- 🔬 Currently: Building ML pipelines and deploying transformers for real-world tasks  
- 🌱 Learning: Model optimization, vector search, and distributed training  
- ⚡ Fun: Competitive programming, performance tuning, reverse engineering
